## What is SQL?

Pronounced `S` `Q` `L` or `Sequel`. Either way is fine!

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. This is the language and syntax we will use to interact with SQL databases. 

When we return and search data from a database we call it Querying.

Common SQL Databases:

Each of these databases can be Queried using the SQL programming Language.

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL
- SQLite 
- Oracle

*Note:* There are some slight differences to each database, but most of the SQL commands we're going to cover will be the same or very similar.
 you can read more about the difference on common SQL databases [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_mysql.asp).

Some other popular databases to keep an eye out for as you continue to learn:

- MongoDB
- Couchbase
- Redis

These are often referred to noSQL databased. Read more about noSQL [here](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
